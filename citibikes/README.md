# About Assignment 3

***

## Environment
All essential packages are included in Anaconda except for ggplot.
ggplot can be installed by simply running the following command in the terminal:

		pip install ggplot

Otherwise, one can comment that line and the program should still go through.


## My Contibution
I participated in the brainstorming about forming the idea and turnning it to the null hypothesis. I wrote the code for this python script and made comments for the notebooks. I also explained the result based on our study.

## Others
We performed a two sample t-test in this assginment despite the fact that we had already noticed the distribution of our samples were higly skewed which was probably also the case for the population. Therefore, the result of our analyisis mught be biased and it was noticed in the ipython notebook.
